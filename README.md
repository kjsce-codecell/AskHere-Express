## Application Structure

- `server.js` - The entry point to our application. This file defines our express server and connects it to MongoDB using mongoose. It also requires the routes and models we'll be using in the application.
- `controllers/` - This folder contains the behaivour for different API calls at different routes.
- `routes/` - This folder contains the route definitions for our API.
- `config/` - This folder contains configuration for Passport as well as a Central Location for Configuration/Environment Variables.
- `models/` - This folder contains the schema definitions for our Mongoose Models.

## Error Handling

In `middlewares/errorHandler.js`, we define a error-handling middleware `errorHandler` in addition with `CustomErrorHandler` at `services/CustomErrorHandler.js`. This middleware will respond with appropriate status code according to request status and format the response to have [error messages the clients can understand](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/blob/master/API.md#errors-and-status-codes)
